I am currently working toward earning my Azure DevOps Engineer Certification.

I enjoy creating Infrastructure as Code deployments for Azure with Bicep templates.  I have recently started learning C# and Python to expand my skills.  I have also been experimenting with Terraform and creating deployments for Azure and other cloud environments.
