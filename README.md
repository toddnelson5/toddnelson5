I am currently working toward earning my Azure DevOps Certification.

I enjoy working with JSON and Bicep and have been experimenting with deploying deployment templates with GitHub Acitons and Azure Pipelines.  I have also been experimenting with Terraform and creating deployments for Azure and other cloud environments.
